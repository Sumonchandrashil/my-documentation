In Bash scripting, you can create and use variables to store and manipulate data. Variables are defined ***without spaces between the variable name, the equal sign, and the assigned value***. 
Here's an example Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a variable named 'name' and assign a value to it
name="Sumon"

# Use the variable in echo statements
echo "Hello, I am $name"
sleep 2
echo "$name is 30 years old."
sleep 2
echo "Going to sleep."
```

In this script:

- We define a variable named `name` and assign the value "Sumon" to it without spaces around the equal sign.
- The variable is then used in `echo` statements by enclosing it in double quotes and preceding it with a dollar sign (`$name`).

When you run this script, it will display the following output:

```
Hello, I am Sumon
Sumon is 30 years old.
Going to sleep.
```

The variable `name` is used to include the value "Sumon" within the printed messages.
