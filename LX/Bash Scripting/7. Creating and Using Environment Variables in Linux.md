Environment variables are useful for storing configuration settings and making them available to your shell sessions and scripts. Here's a step-by-step guide on creating and using environment variables in Linux:

#### Step 0 : Navigate to your home directory:
```bash
cd ~
```

#### Step 1: Set and Call Environment Variables in the Terminal:
**a)** To set an environment variable in the terminal, use the syntax `variableName="Value"`. For example:
```bash
yourVariable="Value"
```

**b)** To display the value of the environment variable, use the `echo` command with the `$` sign before the variable name:
```bash
echo $yourVariable
```

#### Step 2: Making Variables Available in Child Files:
**a)** To make an environment variable available in child files or subshells, use the `export` command:
```bash
export yourVariable
```

**b)** You can then access this variable in a child file (e.g., `fileName.sh`) without redefining it:
**Child File (`fileName.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "The value of yourVariable is: $yourVariable"
```

**c)** Run the child file using the `bash` command:
```bash
bash fileName.sh
```

#### Step 3: Saving Environment Variables Permanently:
To save environment variables permanently, you can add them to your `.bashrc` file, which is executed when you start a new shell session.

**a)** Check if the `.bashrc` file exists using the `ls` command:
```bash
ls -la
```

**b)** Edit your `.bashrc` file using a text editor like `nano`:
```bash
nano .bashrc
```

**c)** Add the `export` statement at the bottom of the file:
```bash
export yourVariable="Value"
```

**d)** Save the changes and exit the text editor.

**e)** #Close your terminal and open a new one. The environment variable will now be available in every new shell session.

Now you've successfully created and used environment variables in Linux, and they will be available across different shell sessions and scripts.
