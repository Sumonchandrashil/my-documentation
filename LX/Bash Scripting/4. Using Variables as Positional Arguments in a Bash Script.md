In a Bash script, you can pass parameters when executing the script and access them using `$1`, `$2`, and so on. These variables allow you to work with the values provided as arguments to your script. 
**Here's an example Bash script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name=$1
age=$2

echo "Good Morning $name"
sleep 1
echo "You are $age years old."
```

**Running the Script:**
You can run the script by providing values as parameters when executing it. For example, if you run the following command:

```bash
bash fileName.sh Sumon 30
```

**Expected Output:**
The script takes the first parameter "Sumon" and assigns it to the variable `name`, and it takes the second parameter "30" and assigns it to the variable `age`. The output will look like this:

```
Good Morning Sumon
You are 30 years old.
```

The script then uses these variables to personalize the messages and display the provided name and age.
