You can perform arithmetic operations in a Bash script using the `$(())` syntax. 
Here's an example Bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "What is your age?"
read age
echo 

echo "What is the sum of 5 + 5? The answer is: $((5 + 5))"
echo 

echo "You will be a millionaire at the age of $((($RANDOM % age) + 32))"
echo
```

When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter their age, and then it will provide the sum of 5 and 5 as well as a prediction based on their age:

**Expected Output:**
```
What is your age?
[User enters their age]

What is the sum of 5 + 5? The answer is: 10

You will be a millionaire at the age of [Random Number]
```

The random number will vary based on the user's input and system configuration.
