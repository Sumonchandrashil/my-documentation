### Shell Scripts and Shebang

- Shell scripts are indicated by the file extension `.sh`.
- The ***shebang*** | ***hashbang*** (`#!`) is used for Interpreter Specification. It defines which interpreter should be used to execute the script.
- You can use various scripting languages, including Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
In this example, `#!/bin/bash` instructs the system to use the Bash shell as the interpreter for the script.

### Executing Shell Scripts

1. To execute a shell script, use the `bash` command followed by the script's filename:
   ```
   bash filename.sh
   ```

2. To make a shell script executable, follow these steps:
   a) Use `chmod +x filename.sh` to add execution permission.
   b) Check if the permission is added using `ls -l filename.sh`.
   c) Execute the script with `./filename.sh`.

### Variables

When declaring variables in shell scripts, ensure you **don't use spaces**.

### Checking File Permissions

To check file permissions in a directory, you can use the `ls -la` command.
