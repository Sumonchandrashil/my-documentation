In a Bash script, you can use the `read` command to take input from the user and assign it to a variable. Here's an example Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "What is your name?" 
read name

echo "Good Morning $name"
sleep 2

echo "You're looking good today, $name!!"
```

**Expected Output:**

When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter their name. Let's assume the user enters "John" as their name. The output will look like this:

```
What is your name?
John
Good Morning John
You're looking good today, John!!
```

The script takes the user's input (in this case, "John") and uses it to personalize the following messages, providing a friendly and welcoming response.
