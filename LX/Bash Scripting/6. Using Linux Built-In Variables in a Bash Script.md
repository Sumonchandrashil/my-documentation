In a Bash script, you can access and use various built-in variables provided by the Linux environment. Here's an example Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo 

# Access and print Linux built-in variables
echo "$HOME, $PWD, $USER, $HOSTNAME, $SHELL, $RANDOM"

echo 
```

**Explanation:**

In this script:

- Built-in Linux variables using the `$` sign. Some of the built-in variables used here are:
  - `$HOME`: The user's home directory.
  - `$PWD`: The current working directory.
  - `$USER`: The current user's username.
  - `$HOSTNAME`: The hostname of the system.
  - `$SHELL`: The current user's default shell.
  - `$RANDOM`: A random number.

When you run this script, it will display the user's name, age, and the values of these built-in variables:

**Expected Output:**

```
What is your name?
[User enters their name]

How old are you?
[User enters their age]

Hello, [User's name]. You are [User's age] years old.

[/home/username], [/current/directory], [username], [hostname], [/bin/bash], [random number]
```

The actual values of the built-in variables will vary based on your system configuration and user inputs.
