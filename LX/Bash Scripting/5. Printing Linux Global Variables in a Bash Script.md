In a Bash script, you can use various Linux commands to retrieve and print global system information. Here's an example Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Use Linux commands and capture their output using $(...)
currentDirectory=$(pwd)
currentUser=$(whoami)
diskFree=$(df -h)

# Print the captured information
echo 
echo "Current Directory is: $currentDirectory"
echo
echo "Current User is: $currentUser"
echo
echo "Disk Free is: $diskFree"
echo 
```

**Explanation:**

In this script:

- We use the `$(...)` syntax to execute Linux commands and capture their output. 
- The captured information is stored in variables (`currentDirectory`, `currentUser`, and `diskFree`).

When you run this script, it will provide system-related information based on the commands executed:

**Expected Output:**

```
Current Directory is: /your/current/directory

Current User is: yourusername

Disk Free is:
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   20G   28G  42% /
...
```

The output will vary based on your system's configuration and disk usage.
