## Creating and Running a Bash Script

### Step 1: Create a Bash Script

First, create a Bash script file named `filename.sh` using your preferred text editor. You can use `nano` for this example:

```bash
nano filename.sh
```

### Step 2: Write the Bash Script

Inside the `filename.sh` file, write the following Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo 
echo "Hello Bash"
sleep 2 
echo "I'm here to learn Bash"
sleep 2 
echo "Practicing Bash"
sleep 2 
echo "Bye, see you again Bash"
echo 
```

### Step 3: Run the Bash Script

You can run the Bash script using the `bash` command:

```bash
bash filename.sh
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Before running the script with `./filename.sh`, you need to make it executable. Follow these steps:

#### a) Add Execution Permission

Use the `chmod` command to add execution permission:

```bash
chmod +x filename.sh
```

#### b) Check Permission

You can check whether the execution permission has been added by running:

```bash
ls -l filename.sh
```

#### c) Run the Executable Script

Finally, run the executable Bash script:

```bash
./filename.sh
```

The script will execute, displaying the specified messages with a 2-second delay between each message.

Now you've successfully created, made executable, and run a Bash script!
